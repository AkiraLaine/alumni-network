### A note to those helping us to beta test this app:
First of all, a sincere __thank you__ from the FCCAN team for taking some time to help us find out if this app is ready for production. We've worked very hard on this so far, and we want to be sure it is in the best possible shape before releasing it to the general freeCodeCamp public. In order to do this, we need your help! We feel fairly confident that this app is in a pretty good place, but we need real users, using it as intended, to help us uncover any bugs that we may have missed.

A couple of things we'd like to point out before you get started:
- According to the rules of the organization, you must have at least one FCC cert to participate (otherwise your account will not authenticate).
- This is a V1.0.0 release - our goal has been to build an MVP that works, and works well, without getting too bogged down in overly complex features. That said, you may come up with some awesome ideas, and if you do, please let us know! However, in keeping with this theme, any fundamental changes or major features will not be entertained until post-production. We have an issue tracking a few things we already have in mind [here](https://github.com/FCC-Alumni/alumni-network/issues/139).
- Please try to use every feature you can, and let's see if we can break this thing!
- What we're really looking to uncover are things like:
  - bugs, big or small
  - functionality flaws
  - any cross browser/platform/device issues that we may have missed
  - typos in our copy
  - etc., etc.
- If you uncover a bug, or have a suggestion or idea, [please report it here](https://github.com/FCC-Alumni/alumni-network/issues/141), and myself (@no-stack-dub-sack) or @bonham000 will check it out reply as soon as we can. For the time being, please do not submit a PR __[1]__.

__[1]__ Lastly, while this _is_, and _always will be_, a completely open source project, we are currently a very small team, and based on how close we are to our first release, we are not prepared to accept contributions from other campers. For now, while we are focused on ironing out the kinks, and without a contributing guide in place, bringing anyone else into the mix and up to speed is too large a challenge. Once we are in production, though, we will welcome contributions with open arms!


__Thanks__ again! We really look forward to your feedback, suggestions, and constructive criticism, and above all, we hope you enjoy the app! Happy networking!

# This is the official home of the freeCodeCamp Alumni Network

freeCodeCamp has an incredible and vibrant international community. We built this app specifically to try and cultivate relationships among experienced campers.

Currently, the [FCC Forum](https://forum.freeCodeCamp.com), [Gitter](https://gitter.im/freeCodeCamp), and other resources provide ample opportunities for campers at any skill level. We wanted to create an environment specifically for more experienced campers who are looking for advanced collaborative projects or mentorship opportunities, as a mentor or mentee.

Our authentication process verifies the FCC progress of users, and only admits students who have completed at least one FCC Certificate (Note: User's will
have to make their FCC profiles public for this validation to work).

Our goal is to create a focused community of like-minded individuals who can benefit from each others culminated experience and expertise, whether in new technologies, programming skills, or career advice.
